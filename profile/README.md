3. Customize the animation with knobs, if needed.
4. At the top-right, you can click the button "Copy CSS" to copy the animation's code.

And here you go! Simple, isn't it?

"Keyframe Base" is now at the design state. So I've created the UI-prototypes and I am going to start the development very soon.
